3) Fraud means any of the following acts committed by insured or by his agent, with the intent to deceive the insurer or to
induce the insurer to issue a life insurance policy:
a. The suggestion, as a fact of that which is not true and which the insured does not believe to be true;
b. The active concealment of a fact by the insured having knowledge or belief of the fact;
c. Any other act fitted to deceive; and
d. Any such act or omission as the law specifically declares to be fraudulent.
4) Mere silence is not fraud unless, depending on circumstances of the case, it is the duty of the insured or his agent
keeping silence to speak or silence is in itself equivalent to speak.
5) No Insurer shall repudiate a life insurance Policy on the ground of Fraud, if the Insured / beneficiary can prove that the
misstatement was true to the best of his knowledge and there was no deliberate intention to suppress the fact or that
such mis-statement of or suppression of material fact are within the knowledge of the insurer. Onus of disproving is
upon the policyholder, if alive, or beneficiaries.
6) Life insurance Policy can be called in question within 3 years on the ground that any statement of or suppression of a
fact material to expectancy of life of the insured was incorrectly made in the proposal or other document basis which
policy was issued or revived or rider issued. For this, the insurer should communicate in writing to the insured or legal
representative or nominee or assignees of insured, as applicable, mentioning the ground and materials on which
decision to repudiate the policy of life insurance is based.
7) In case repudiation is on ground of mis-statement and not on fraud, the premium collected on policy till the date of
repudiation shall be paid to the insured or legal representative or nominee or assignees of insured, within a period of 90
days from the date of repudiation.
8) Fact shall not be considered material unless it has a direct bearing on the risk undertaken by the insurer. The onus is on
insurer to show that if the insurer had been aware of the said fact, no life insurance policy would have been issued to
the insured.
9) The insurer can call for proof of age at any time if he is entitled to do so and no policy shall be deemed to be called in
question merely because the terms of the policy are adjusted on subsequent proof of age of life insured. So, this Section
will not be applicable for questioning age or adjustment based on proof of age submitted subsequently.
